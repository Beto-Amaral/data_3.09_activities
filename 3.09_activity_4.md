# 3.09 Activity 4

Given the following simulated data, check visually the effects of basic `RandomUnderSampler` and `RandomOverSampler` methods from the `imblearn` library on the data. Do you think it is a good result? How could it be improved?

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler

X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=[100, 1000], cluster_std=4, n_features=2, random_state=42)
```
